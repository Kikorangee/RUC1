# RUC License Management Add-In - Project Summary

## Project Overview

Successfully developed a professional Road User Charge (RUC) License Management module that integrates directly with MyGeotab to monitor vehicle odometer readings and provide timely alerts for license renewals.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Fleet Monitoring**: Automatically fetches live odometer data from Geotab devices
- **Smart Alert System**: Notifies when vehicles are within 2000km of license expiry
- **License Renewal Process**: Easy renewal with 1000km, 5000km, or 10000km options
- **Data Persistence**: Maintains renewal history using browser localStorage
- **Device Matching**: Automatically matches fleet vehicles to Geotab devices

### User Interface
- **Professional Design**: Modern, clean interface with black/white color scheme
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Dashboard Overview**: Summary cards showing total vehicles, alerts, and active licenses
- **Fleet Table**: Comprehensive view of all 86 vehicles with real-time status
- **Modal Dialogs**: Intuitive license renewal interface
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges (Critical/Warning/OK)

### Technical Implementation
- **MyGeotab Integration**: Full API integration for device and odometer data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Efficient data loading and 5-minute auto-refresh
- **Testing**: Mock API mode for development and testing
- **Security**: No hardcoded credentials, uses MyGeotab's authentication

## 📊 Fleet Data Processing

Successfully converted and processed fleet data:
- **Total Vehicles**: 86 vehicles from Excel file
- **Data Format**: Clean JSON structure with vehicle descriptions, fleet numbers, registration plates, and RUC limits
- **Alert Detection**: Identified 4 vehicles requiring immediate attention (0km remaining)
- **Active Licenses**: 82 vehicles with valid licenses
